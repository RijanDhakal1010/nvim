At this point in the setup I have:
- Used the `plugins.lua` script from [this tutorial](https://alpha2phi.medium.com/neovim-for-beginners-init-lua-45ff91f741cb) as is for my setup.
- The `plugins.lua` could use some pcalls to make it safer but nothing urgernt as of now.
- Does not yet have a welcome screen.
